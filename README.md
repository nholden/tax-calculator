# Tax Calculator

A toy application I’m working on to learn to [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). Using Alpine.js and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), nearly all of the content, styling, and functionality lives in [the markup](dist/index.html), with some light JavaScript sprinkles and no custom CSS. ✨

## Development

Open the application in a web browser with live reloading:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Build the assets for production:

```
npm run build
```
